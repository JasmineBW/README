### Descriptions
#### README
- An app that combines the best part of Wattpad and any ebook reader. Gives users the ability to read published, licensed books but with a community. Users can comment and reply to comments on select lines of the book, upvote comments, like and dislike other people's comments, and also review. Users will also be able to chat with other users about books stemming from the comments they've publicly made or reviews they've left.

- **Mobile:** From my experience, a mobile reading app has always been preferred to a website reading experience. With how easy it is to swipe on a screen, users will prefer reading on a mobile device. With camera, users can scan book barcodes to read them on the app. Real-time updates of replies and texts as well.

- **Story:** As a reader, when reading books nothing is more appealing than having someone who you can scream or discuss about the book at the same time with. Wattpad gave users that freedom, but for self-authored books, but now everyone who reads can have access to the same feeling and the community of people reading the same book as them at the same time.

- **Market:** Any body who wants to discuss books would be willing to use this app. I think this would also encourage people who don't read as much to pursue more reading cause there are people to share it with.

- **Habit:** As with most books, there's a high chance that people get addicted to the app and the ability to access insights of others and express comments as they feel them in real time on the app.

- **Scope:** I don't think I can complete the app in the timeframe of what is available for the class, however, after the course ends, i'll definitely be able to implement all features and think up new ones as well.


#### GLOBEY
- The travel itinerary app where users can create their TODO lists for each trip and save all the corresponding details. From plane tickets to day-to-day plans for an international trip to Japan or a day trip back to your hometown, GLOBEY is the aggregating app for all your trip needs.
